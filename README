BandKit is a Kotlin Multiplatform API wrapper around basic Bandcamp functions to help you create your own projects.

Platforms
---------
BandKit is written in pure Kotlin and so it should support any platform supported by JetBrains.
This includes, but is not limited to:
    - JVM
    - Android
    - Native (Desktop)
        > Windows (via MinGW)
        > MacOS
        > Linux
    - Native (Mobile)
        > Android NDK
        > iOS / tvOS / watchOS

Capabilities
------------
BandKit is currently capable of:
    - Fetching user-related data, including profile information, followers, and following
    - Fetching library data, and exposes stream URLs in MP3-V0 format

Upcoming features include:
    - Bandcamp Radio support
    - Downloading purchased albums in full quality, with full codec support
    - Recommendations based on genre and location
    - Proper pagination support where applicable

Downloading
-----------
BandKit is currently only available on Github via Github Packages.
Maven Central support is upcoming once the library is more complete.

Support for KMP libraries is unavailable in JitPack, so support isn't planned for now:

Documentation
-------------
Dokka integration is planned and upcoming.

Contribution
------------
This repository requires much more information before I can consider it stable.

To contribute type-data, search for values typed as `JsonElement`. These are deserialized as strings for now.
To contribute contextual information, search for comments with "MORE INFO NEEDED".

I am also considering adding further "helper" functions, which would mean implementing concrete models of data.
This is unplanned, pending thoughts from other contributors, along with better type specification for endpoint data.
